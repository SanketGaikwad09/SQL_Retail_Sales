# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `sql_project1`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `sql_project1`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_project1;

drop table if exists retail_sales;
CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
select count(*) from retail_sales;
select count(distinct customer_id) fro  retail_sales;
select distinct category from retail_sales;

select * from retail_sales
where 
	transactions_id is null or sale_date is null or sale_time is null
        or customer_id is null or gender is null or age is null
        or category is null or quantity is null or price_per_unit is null 
	or cogs is null or total_sale is null;

delete from retail_sales
where 
	transactions_id is null or sale_date is null or sale_time is null
        or customer_id is null or gender is null or age is null
        or category is null or quantity is null or price_per_unit is null
        or cogs is null or total_sale is null;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
select *
from retail_sales
where sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
select category, sum(quantity)
from retail_sales
where category ='Clothing'
group by 1;

select * 
from retail_sales
where 
category ='Clothing'
and
to_char(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
and 
quantity >=4
```

3. **calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
select 
    category,
    sum(total_sale) as net_sale,
    count(*) as total_orders
 from retail_sales
 group by 1
```

4. **average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
select
    round(avg(age), 2) as avg_age
from retail_sales
where category = 'Beauty'
```

5. **Find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
select * from retail_sales
where total_sale > 1000
```

6. **Find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
select 
    category,
    gender,
    count(*) as total_trans
from retail_sales
group by 
    category,
    gender
order by 1
```

7. **Calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
select 
    year,
    month,
    avg_sale
from
(    
select 
    extract(year from sale_date) as year,
    extract(month from sale_date) as month,
    avg(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    rank() over(partition by extract(year from sale_date) order by avg(total_sale) desc) as Rnk
from retail_sales
group by 1, 2
) as t1
where Rnk = 1
```

8. **Find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
select 
    customer_id,
    sum(total_sale) as total_sales
from retail_sales
group by 1
order by 2 desc
limit 5
```

9. **Find unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
select 
    category,
    count(distinct customer_id) as count_unique_cs
from retail_sales
group by category;
```

10. **Create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
with hourly_sale
as
(
select *,
	case
	when extract(hour from sale_time) < 12 then 'Morning'
        when extract(hour from sale_time) between 12 and 17 then 'Afternoon'
        else 'Evening'
	end as shift
from retail_sales
)
select 
	shift,
    count(*) as total_orders
from hourly_sale
group by shift;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
